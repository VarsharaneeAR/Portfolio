        I have the inclination to learn, try and experience new things. Playing sports has been a vital part of my life since primary school. In high school, the squash court became one of my favourite places. I enjoyed it and did well. I was privileged to have played for my Highschool‚Äôs team through my 6 years and captained my final year as well as qualified for nationals. I was able to receive full colours which are awarded to students when they reach such an achievement in their respective sport. In university, I enjoyed and played floorball. Floorball allowed me to make friends and come out of my shell. I was also able to captain my team in my final year of university.
        Learning languages is important to me because other than being fun, languages can help break barriers and strengthen relationships as well as open opportunities for new experiences. In high school, I studied french and during COVID I began learning Mandarin and Korean with the hope to work and live in these countries in the future. 
        Volunteer work and fundraising are other interests of mine and thankfully, I have had many experiences such as climbing Mt Kili to fundraise, being Vice-President of Interact in Highschool and volunteering in two main programs at University. Firstly, the CHATS program where we assisted individuals who immigrated to Australia and required assistance with tasks to help acclimatize them within Australian Society. The second program placed me in a primary school where I assisted students who require more assistance and attention within the classroom. Additionally, I have volunteered as a UN Youth Facilitator. I wish to continue volunteering in the future and enjoy learning from the different experiences. 
        Of course, like most people, eating, travelling, dancing, reading, and watching TV bring me joy as well! üòäüòäüòä
